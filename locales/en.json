  "welcome": "👋 Hello, {name}!\n\nWelcome to the Crypto Word Game. This is a word guessing game with a cryptographic twist.\n\n<b>What is Cryptography?</b>\nSimply put, it's the art of 'encoding' messages. In this game, every letter is encoded into a number based on a secret key or 'shift'.\n\n<b>How does the game work?</b>\nWe use a classic method called the <i>Caesar Cipher</i>. Normally, A=1, B=2, etc. But with a 'shift', the key can change, for example, A might become 2 or 3! Your task is to guess the hidden letters based on these numeric clues.\n\nType /crypto to start your first game, or /help if you need guidance.",

We use a <b>cipher</b>, which is a set of rules, to turn readable text into a secret code.\n\nThis game uses the <i>Caesar Cipher</i>, one of the oldest ciphers. It works by 'shifting' the position of each letter in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1:\n  A becomes B (value 2)\n  B becomes C (value 3)\n\nEach puzzle in this bot can have a different shift, making it more challenging!",
